Let I introduce myself!
    I am a new youth born in the millennium in 2003!
         This year is 2021. After experiencing the super-scale pneumonia flu in the world second only to the Black Death in the Middle Ages,
         I and our partners who are committed to making our world and our only real home more suitable for people to live in, 
         Finally realized what we must do.
                We joined the globals shapers shanghai community, Davos Lab in Shanghai. An innovation group portal was established.
                Cooperate with sustainable development & environmental protection organizations such as XUNHUANPAI and China Youth Climate Protection Organization CYCAN.
    We are currently operating projects such as:
                                                BREAD IN HANDS,
                                                               a platform for academic exchanges and sharing of innovative ideas
                                                               and teamwork between global universities and high school students, 
                                                               and technical creation and adjustment are currently in progress.
                                                THE BETA BALANCE,
                                                                 is developed for young people aged 12-22, 
                                                                 so that people all over the world can realize what kind of world the earth they face and live in.
    We will meet high school students, junior high school students, and even elementary school students in the confused period.
    /Provide a new spherical model of life philosophy/.
    
    We will provide a new sight to young people in underdeveloped areas who have no chance to go to school.
    We will provide new white-collar workers and blue-collar workers who have entered the workplace with new directions in their lives.
    Help them understand that they have previously ignored and did not understand other parts of the world.
    
    Let everyone know that they live in this world, the meaning they face, know their ideals and missions, is our first goal in developing this platform.
    Let everyone be able to keep up with the development of the world in an era of raging epidemics.
    
    Learning the new development direction of the current world, understanding art and computers, is the knowledge that every person who wants to live a better life, 
    or even want to develop their own business, must understand.
    
    How can we gain a firm foothold in the coming era of artificial intelligence, seize opportunities,
    and let more ambitious young people who are troubled by lack of contacts and knowledge, can live better and make our world better? 
    
    To become more balanced, not fairer, is our mission.
    
    
    
                           Balancing ourselves, balancing us, balancing life, balancing study and work, and balancing the world are our second mission.
                           
                           
                           To help the right people is to help the right self.
                           
                           Adhere to logical judgments and reject perceptual thinking.
                           
                           These two sentences are the motto of our innovation team.
                           
                           
                           
                           
                                                                                    Introduced my philosophy of life and our project profile,
                                                                                    it's time to introduce me and my team partners!
